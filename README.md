# Background World_Weather_Analysis


Jack loves the PlanMyTrip app. Beta testers love it too. And, as with any new product, they've recommended a few changes to take the app to the next level. Specifically, they recommend adding the weather description to the weather data.

For this challenge, I have used  the weather description data already retrieved to enhance the PlanMyTrip app. I've taken the help of the beta testers to input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which are used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. The beta tester have choosen four cities from the list of potential travel destinations to create a travel itinerary. 

Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, I have created a travel route between the four cities and a marker layer map.
